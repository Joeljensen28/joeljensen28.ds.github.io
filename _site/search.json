It was a project I developed for a local baseball team in Idaho Falls which aims to make a prediction on what the next pitch type will be based on the previous five pitches and other conditions that can be recorded pre-pitch. The data was scattered across a few different folders in the repository, so the project began with some wrangling, compiling all the pitch data we had into one single datatable with about 180,000 rows. After that, I removed all features that could not be detected pre-pitch, made the dataset ML-ready, and developed the deep learning model using tools such as tensorflow and kerastuner."

In my church, if the president passes away, then the apostle with the greatest seniority becomes the next president. I’m aiming to build a machine learning model that can predict whether or not an apostle will ever become president. I started by scraping data from wikipedia on all the Church’s apostles, past and present, including their birthday, date ordained into the quorum of the twelve apostles, and whether or not they ever became president. Primarily from the first two, I was able to derive their age at ordination, the age of all other apostles at the date of their ordination, and other critical features helpful for predicting if they will become president."

I found a dataset of all reported crashes in the city of New York over the span of several years, along with another dataset of every registered vehicle in NYC. With this, I was able to determine what percentage of motorcyclists actually get in crashes, and how that compares to other types of vehicles."

I’m currently immersed in data cleansing, analytics, machine learning, and programming. I am fascinated with statistics, computing, and deep learning fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analysis.\nMy primary focus is on building my skillset to become the best machine learning engineer I can be. My goal is to obtain a PhD, become a machine learning expert, and help build models that unlock the potential of data and propel industry into a future of innovation!"

It was a project I developed for a local baseball team in Idaho Falls which aims to make a prediction on what the next pitch type will be based on the previous five pitches and other conditions that can be recorded pre-pitch. The data was scattered across a few different folders in the repository, so the project began with some wrangling, compiling all the pitch data we had into one single datatable with about 180,000 rows. After that, I removed all features that could not be detected pre-pitch, made the dataset ML-ready, and developed the deep learning model using tools such as tensorflow and kerastuner."

In my church, if the president passes away, then the apostle with the greatest seniority becomes the next president. I’m aiming to build a machine learning model that can predict whether or not an apostle will ever become president. I started by scraping data from wikipedia on all the Church’s apostles, past and present, including their birthday, date ordained into the quorum of the twelve apostles, and whether or not they ever became president. Primarily from the first two, I was able to derive their age at ordination, the age of all other apostles at the date of their ordination, and other critical features helpful for predicting if they will become president."

I wanted to learn if it was actually more dangerous to ride a motorcycle, and if so, why. I found a dataset of all reported crashes in the city of New York over the span of several years, along with another dataset of every registered vehicle in NYC. With this, I was able to determine what percentage of motorcyclists actually get in crashes, and how that compares to other types of vehicles."
